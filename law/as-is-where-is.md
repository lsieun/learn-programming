# Demystifying the ‘as is where is’ basis

In property transactions, the term “**as is where is**” is a term or condition of a sale where **the property is sold based on whatever condition it exists in, that the buyer accepts it “with all faults”, whether or not immediately apparent**.

For example, a secondary property may have defects which can only be detected later by a contractor or plumber, but the purchaser should inspect the property with these professionals’ advice before the transaction. 

Even **primary properties** sold by housing developers which are completed but not issued a Certificate of Completion and Compliance may be sold under an ‘**as is where is**’ basis. Under such circumstances, the housing developer does not need to give any warranty to the purchases or make good any defect found on the property after the sale of the property.

As for the seller, the concept of ‘**as is where is**’ becomes a defensive mechanism. Defending the asking price of the property will hinge on the concept of ‘as is where is’. The seller can claim that any defects on the property were already considered before the asking price was announced to the world. It is like an announcement by the seller saying, “There is something wrong with this house but if you are willing to buy it at the price I am asking, let’s make a deal.”
