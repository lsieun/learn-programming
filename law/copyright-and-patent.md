# The Difference Between Copyright And Patent

URL: http://cjam.info/en/difference-copyright-and-patent/

**Patents** refer to an invention, whereas **copyrights** refer to the expression of an idea, such as an artistic work. They are governed by different rules, so it is important to know which is applicable to your works.

## COPYRIGHT

**Copyrights** protect the expression of ideas. **Artistic works are generally considered to be expressions of ideas** – books, paintings, songs, movies, and computer programs are examples. Copyright will not protect the process through which a particular work was created or the use of information within it (instructions, etc.).

> 艺术作品，通常被认为是expressions of ideas

Cookbooks(菜谱；食谱) are often used to illustrate the difference between **the expression of an idea** and **the idea itself**. Cookbooks cannot be reproduced without permission because they are an expression of ideas (the recipes食谱；配方). However, people can still follow the recipes in the cookbook because they are replicating the ideas contained in the literary work. If the recipes were protected by a patent, users would need permission to follow them, since patents protect particular ideas from being used without authorization.

## PATENT

A patent is a right, granted by the government, to exclude others from making, using, or selling your invention. **The central idea** is that **patents protect ideas**, not just **expressions of them**. 

Patents protect inventions such as new processes, machines, or chemicals. 

The primary goal of the patent law is to encourage innovation and commercialization of technological advances. Patent law incentivizes inventors to publicly disclose their inventions in exchange for certain exclusive rights. 

The main effect of patents is to give their holders the right to challenge any use of the invention by a third party. He thereby gave a temporary monopoly of exploitation which can be understood as a financial incentive for inventive industrial activities.
 

**版权**（copyright）是英美法系的概念。从其英文原词可以看出，版权的最初意思就是“**复制权**”，是 **为了阻止他人未经许可复制作品、损害作者经济利益而由法律创设的权利**。因为过去印刷术并不普及，当时社会上认为，附随于 **著作物**最重要的权利莫过于 **将之印刷出版之权**，故有此称呼。**版权的侧重点也在于保护作者的经济权利**。


专利，可以视作鼓励、刺激创作作品的公共政策的产物。
